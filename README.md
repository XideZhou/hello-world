# hello-world
Just for a try.
Hello everyone i am here to have a try of github.I knew github for so long a time,but never tried to write anything on it.I find that it is a little bit slow for me to take operation on github in China,there may be no servers in Chinese MainLand.I am currently focus on android linux kernel drivers.
